# Python - Hello, World

In this project, I began practicing using the interpreter, printing text
and variables, and indexing and slicing strings in Python.

## Tasks

* **0. Hello, print**
  * **2-print.py:** Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is
  like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line using the function `print`.

* **1. Print integer**
  * **3-print_number.py:** Python script that prints the integer stored
  in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.

* **2. Print float**
  * **4-print_float.py:** Python script that prints the float stored
  in the variable `number` with a precision of two digits.

* **3. Print string**
  * **5-print_string.py:** Python script that prints a string stored
  in the variable `str` three times, then a new line, then the first nine characters
  contained in `str`, followed by another new line.

* **4. Play with strings**
  * **6-concat.py:** Python script that prints `Welcome to Holberton
  School!` using the variables `str1 = "Holberton"` and `str2 = "School"`.

* **5. Copy - Cut - Paste**
  * **7-edges.py:** Python script that sets three string variables based
  on the string contained in the variable `word` as follows:
  * `word_first_3`: Contains the first three letters of the variable `word`.
  * `word_last_2`: Contains the last two letters of the variable `word`.
  * `middle_word`: Contains the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters.

* **6. Create a new sentence**
  * **8-concat_edges.py:** Python script that prints `object-oriented
  programming with Python`, followed by a new line without creating new variables or
  string literals.

* **7. Easter Egg**
  * **9-easter_egg.py:** Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by
  Tim Peters, followed by a new line.
